        <p> 
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI am a Mechanical Engineer currently working as a
          Software Engineer for CoinMode. I am responsible for mostly for our <strong>backend</strong> and <strong>infrastructure</strong>
          where a few of the core/utilities APIs were completelly developed by me. I am currenlty studying <strong>Kubernetes</strong> for the CKA exam.
          &nbsp
        </p>

        <p> 
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere is a few of the APIs I am currently working on:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://api.coinmode.com/docs_all/"><strong>Main API</strong></a> - The CoinMode API,  the onlu one in this list that was not entirely written by me. Currenlty responsible for maintaining and its further development.</li>
            <li><a href="https://giftcards.coinmode.com/docs"><strong>GiftCards</strong></a> - Completelly independent API that will make giftcards available to buy, will make a cashback available to CoinMode users, has its own SQL database</li>
            <li><a href="https://discord.coinmode.com/private"><strong>Discord Bot</strong></a> - A Discord Bot that enable users to register and make transfers using Discord, also has a complete backend API to communicate and enable Discord integration with all CoinMode services, has its own Redis Database</li>
            <li><a href="https://statement.coinmode.com/docs"><strong>Statement Generator</strong></a> - Responsible for generating a transaction report for any account. Available in PDF (Native), CSV, xlsx and html</li>
            <li><a href="https://tools.coinmode.com/docs/"><strong>Tools</strong></a> - Small internal tools, Although this is a recent one it will contain most of our internal tools.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBeyond dealing with backend development I am also responsible for most of the infrastructure. <br/>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese responsabilities include:
          <ul>
            <li>Updating and mantaining a few of our VPS machines on <strong>Proxmox</strong> and <strong>GCE</strong></li>
            <li>All of the Kubernetes Clusters, where I was able to fully migrate all services to our new Gitlab managed Kubernetes cluster for both Staging and Production</li>
            <li>Automated End-To-End tests using Cypress for each deployment on our CI/CD pipelines</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI have always been a tech enthusiast; I started
          building computers since the age of 10. My appreciation for technology
          pointed me to engineering and software development. Since the early
          days I have always been an autodidact, when I was 12 years old I
          started my own server for an online role-playing game that I enjoyed,
          this involved dealing with SQL, PHP, DHCP, virtual servers and
          firewalls. Today, people turn to me when it comes to advice for
          everything electronic, to which I happily offer my guidance. Being an
          autodidact immensely helped me as years later I needed those skills in
          my family’s business. I was responsible for implementing and deploying
          the main server (login, files, DNS, DHCP, VPN), 3D printing server,
          PABX, website, maintenance and tracking database, virtual servers,
          surveillance cameras/alarm, among others IT-related tasks.
