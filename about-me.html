        <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI am a Mechanical Engineer currently working as a
          support engineer for a company that produces MRI machines for
          veterinary use. I am responsible for 1st and 2nd line support; this
          calls for quick reactions as we are normally dealing with customers
          that are scanning emergency patients and need fixes in very little
          time, not only I support external clients but also our own service
          engineers when a visit is needed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI have always been a tech enthusiast; I started
          building computers since the age of 10. My appreciation for technology
          pointed me to engineering and software development. Since the early
          days I have always been an autodidact, when I was 12 years old I
          started my own server for an online role-playing game that I enjoyed,
          this involved dealing with SQL, PHP, DHCP, virtual servers and
          firewalls. Today, people turn to me when it comes to advice for
          everything electronic, to which I happily offer my guidance. Being an
          autodidact immensely helped me as years later I needed those skills in
          my family’s business. I was responsible for implementing and deploying
          the main server (login, files, DNS, DHCP, VPN), 3D printing server,
          PABX, website, maintenance and tracking database, virtual servers,
          surveillance cameras/alarm, among others IT-related tasks. My current
          personal project is learning programming though game development, I am
          currently learning C# and Python on my free time as I believe this
          will be a great addition to my work skills and has already enabled me
          to proactively develop .NET software tools that improved response time
          on support cases reducing downtime for all systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy first engineering internship was at Ford Motor
          Company, I started working as an intern in product development in body
          interior (Instrument Panel/Console). After my first couple of months
          at Ford I stated taking care of more complex tasks such as leading
          part design changes and part analysis. That is where I first started
          working with a CAD software. After almost 2 years I started working
          with 3D printing and became fascinated with it. I started studying
          Solidworks and in the last few years I gained excellent working
          knowledge in developing parts in CAD.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSince then, I designed many custom parts for
          costumers and for myself, I have helped our BAJA SAE team at
          university by rebuilding the chassis and helping with FEA simulation.
          I became a volunteer tutor of Computer-aided design for a semester
          with regular weekly independent classes (6 hours/week). My final year
          Project (“An analysis of material robustness under the scope of
          quality and good practices in FDM PLA 3D print”) involved developing
          good skills on 3d printing, Solidworks, tensile strength and polymers.
          I have developed a comparative method between different parameters,
          relating them with surface quality and tensile strength to promote
          continuous improvement and optimization of the 3D printing process
          through Fused Deposition Modelling. Passed with distinction (10 out of
          10).
